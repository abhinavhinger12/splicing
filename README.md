# splicing
Research and Code for analysing Genome Sequences and Annotation to predict Splice Sites using Deep Neural Networks.

## TODO
* Create a Character Level RNN with Pytorch [Karpathy](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn)
* Data Preparation from Intron data and fasta files
* Multi Label Classification of Splice Sites with input as 80 characters around the donor or acceptor and ouput as Bins or Splice Sites
